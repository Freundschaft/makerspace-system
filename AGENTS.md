# Repository Guidelines
This guide keeps contributors aligned with the makerspace management platform's Next.js 15 + Prisma stack. Follow it before committing or opening a pull request.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` hosts routes, `app/api` handlers, and scoped helpers under `app/components`; co-locate feature fragments beside their page.
- `components/` provides shared UI built on shadcn; add new primitives in PascalCase files or extend `components/ui` patterns.
- `data/` holds static fixtures; `lib/` exposes the Prisma client and cross-cutting utilities; `prisma/` owns the schema, migrations, and seed script.
- `public/` serves static assets; `generated/prisma` is regenerated by `prisma generate`, so never edit it manually.

## Build, Test & Development Commands
- `npm run dev` launches the Turbopack dev server with hot reload.
- `npm run build` compiles production assets; run it before release branches.
- `npm run start` serves the optimized build locally or in staging.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint with the Next.js config; fix all findings or use `npm run lint -- --fix`.
- `npm run prisma:seed` repopulates the database; pair it with `npx prisma migrate dev` after schema changes.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Write TypeScript by default and keep strong typing, leaning on `zod` for runtime checks. Prettier defaults apply (2-space indent, double quotes, semicolons); let `npm run lint -- --fix` resolve spacing. Components live in PascalCase files, hooks and utilities use camelCase, and route folders stay kebab-case. Reuse Tailwind-based primitives from `components/ui` before inventing new patterns.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated testing is pending; when adding suites, colocate `*.test.tsx` beside features or under `__tests__` and favor React Testing Library. For now, rely on `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and manual passes through login, team, and bicycle flows. Capture new manual steps in the PR discussion so others can replay them.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
History ("add team", "add bicycle rental page") favors short, imperative subjects, so follow that style and add scope prefixes when clarifying ("add team: list sorting"). Keep commits focused and PRs concise: include intent, linked issue, schema or seed notes, and visuals for UI changes. Confirm lint/build status before requesting review.

## Environment & Data Management
A `.env` with `DATABASE_URL` powers Prisma; never commit secrets. After schema edits run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <change>` followed by `npx prisma generate`, then reseed via `npm run prisma:seed`. Treat everything in `generated/` as disposable output and regenerate instead of hand editing.
